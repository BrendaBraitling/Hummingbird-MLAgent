# Hummingbird-MLAgent

Checking out Adam Kelly's Machine Learning Agent Lessons on learn.unity.com ... 

Adam utilizes Anaconda to manage Python 3.7 and MLagent.  

Noting that June 2020 Unity's github has deprecated Anaconda in the docs... 

I will use Anaconda for the tutorial, but after finishing Adam's lessons I will check out the latest methods! :)

Update 2020-09-08

Have not had the time to look at the Anaconda Deprecation.

Have been able to utlize the Hummingbird MLAgent with Unity 2019.4 LTS (Long Term Support) 

Concerned about the energy inefficient learning process and have begun to ponder how we might use design factors to improve model development.

To that end, my use case user stories....

As a Data Scientist:

    I need to...
    
      learn more about Data Oriented Technology Stack in Unity.  
      
    Because...
    
      This will allow me to feed in and present data in Unity Scenarios with MLAgents in mind.

As A Data Designer:

    I need to...
    
      explore how to use the Microsoft CSharp scripting elements like Entities and Interfaces
    
    Because...
       
       Unity seems to be coupling fairly tightly with Microsoft products like Visual Studio, C # scripts etc.
        
        This will allow me to utilize scripts to feed data from data systems into Unity so I can visualize relationships and attributes more descriptively.
        
        it will allow me to structure external data efficiently for use with Unity DOTS scenarios that I design.
