# Hummingbird-MLAgent
Checking out Adam Kelly's Machine Learning Agent Lessons on learn.unity.com... 

Adam utilizes Anaconda to manage Python 3.7 and malagent.  Noting that June 2020 Unity's github has depracated Anaconda in the docs... 

I will use Anaconda but then after Adam's lessons are done, I will check out the latest methods! :)
